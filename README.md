# Arsam's_Portfolio
Data Analytics Portfolio of projects worked on
# [Project 1: E-Commerce store Sales Dashboard](https://github.com/ArsamData/Arsam_Portfolio/blob/main/Sales%20Dashboard.pbix)
* Created an interactive dashboard using Power BI to showcase the sales performance for an online store over the years.
* Cleaned the data by addressing duplicate and missing values, correcting table headers and ensuring correct format for different columns like date and sales (dollars).
* Applied advanced filtering to highlight Top 10 customers, Top 5 most profitable products and bottom 5 products resulting in a loss.
* Created new fields/columns called ‘Year’ and ‘No of delivery days’.
* The Year column is essential in making the dashboard interactive by shifting the visualizations according to the year selected and is extremely important for monitoring of sales metrics and other KPIs for the business. 
* Created visualizations for sales across different demographics to better understand the consumer market across various regions and segments

## Visualize Data in Power BI
  Developed an interactive dashboard in Power BI to answer the following key questions of the stakeholders;
### 1) 'Is our hotel revenue growing by year?'
### 2) 'Should we increase our parking lot size?'
### 3) 'What trends can we see in the data?'

* Created a new custom column called 'Revenue'

# Project 1: Online Store Sales Dashboard 
* Created an interactive dashboard using Power BI to showcase the sales performance for an online store over the years.
* Cleaned the data by addressing duplicate and missing values, correcting table headers and ensuring correct format for different columns like date and sales (dollars).
* Applied advanced filtering to highlight Top 10 customers, Top 5 most profitable products and bottom 5 products resulting in a loss.
* Created new fields/columns called ‘Year’ and ‘No of delivery days’.
* The Year column is essential in making the dashboard interactive by shifting the visualizations according to the year selected and is extremely important for monitoring of * sales metrics and other KPIs for the business. 
* Created visualizations for sales across different demographics to better understand the consumer market across various regions and segments
